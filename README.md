<p align="center">A Unity code library of tools & pre-build solutions to problems. </p>

# Adriana
> Version 0.1.0

A work in progress code library of verified systems that I use in my projects made publically available with documentation for all parts of the project. This will be updated in small steps as each system is tested and to ensure it works as it was intended before being publically released to the main branch. 

## Contents
It is still early days for this project, so more will be added once it has been verified & documented correctly. 
- Clamped Values
- Events System

## Upcoming
- Reflection Helper
- Extension Methods
- Min/Max Values
- Get Random/Chance/DiceRoll
- Camera Shake
- Screen Wrapping
- Journal System
& More!

## How to install
Simply download the repo and import its contents into Unity or download the latest release and import the package into Unity with the custom package import. In the future there will be the git URL option as well, but that is a bit down the line. 

## F.A.Q
Why Adriana?
> Honestly, I just couldn't think of a project name for a code-base that I actually liked. So I just picked the first name to came to mind that sounded nice, and Adriana was that name. 

What is the overall goal for this project?
> For me it is to have a stable base code library that I can adapt of work off in a variety of game projects. 

Why Unity?
> Its the engine I work in for my day job and is the one I'm most familiar with. 

Can I contribute to this project?
> At present I am not accepting contributions to the official repository. This is intended as a personal project for the time being. I may change this in the future. 

Can I make suggestions for changes?
> Ofcourse, if you find a flaw, please do let me know. You will be credited on both the homepage & section documentation as well as in the commit in question that fixes the issue.
